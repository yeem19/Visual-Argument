# Visual-Argument
The purpose of my visual argument was to shed light on a very heavy and controversial topic in our society. Guns have become the leading deaths among Amercia's children. The lack of gun control and safety is very alarming and poses a great threat to America's future generations. Instead of worrying what school lunch they have to pack for their children or who is carpooling to school that day, parents are now faced with the harsh reality of "what if another child brings a gun to school today? Is my child going to come home?". These are questions that no parent should have to ask themselves on a daily basis. School is supposed to be a safety place for these children to learn and grow as individuals and as our future generations. However, they are burdened by the anxieties of their peers possibly bringing a fire weapon that can take their lives and the lives of their best friends. I wanted to show the magnitude of this issue by showing the various locations where school shootings have taken place and the amount of children it has taken from us. When is it enough? At what point will our politicians recognize that these children's lives are more important than owning a firearm?
